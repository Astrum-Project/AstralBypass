# AstralBypass
Bypass MelonLoader integrity checks without modifying MelonLoader

# Usage
This is a plugin. Not a mod

# Disclaimer
This plugin does not endourse anyone using it, as anyone can.

This plugin is **universal**, not VRChat specific. It does not interact with any assemblies other than MelonLoader's
- AstralCore is VRChat specific but a port could be made

Some people choose to make up lies because they don't like freedom:
